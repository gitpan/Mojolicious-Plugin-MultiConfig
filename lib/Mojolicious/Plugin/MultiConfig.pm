=head1 NAME

Mojolicious::Plugin::MultiConfig - Load multiple configs and merge

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.2

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.2';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	# In Mojo startup()...

	my $config = $self->plugin('multi_config', foo => 'bar');
	say($config->{this});
	say($self->config->{that});

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Mojolicious::Plugin::MultiConfig> is a wrapper around L<Config::Any> to load multiple configuration files and merge them together.

The default behaviour is to load 3 config files based on templates containing moniker (%a), mode (%m), username (%u) and file extenstion (%e):

* %a.%e
* %a.%m.%e
* %a.%m.%u.%e

The config files are loaded in order, with later files in the chain overwriting option(s) in the previous config file.

The filenames are configurable, see OPTIONS section below.

Missing config files are ignored without error. (TODO: config option to be added in the near future ensure an error).

=head1 OPTIONS

L<Mojolicious::Plugin::MultiConfig> supports some options. They can be passed as named args. e.g.:

	$self->plugin('multi_config', option1 => 'value1', foo => 'bar');

=head2 moniker

	moniker => 'appconfig'

Will use this value in place of %a (moniker) in filenames. Defaults to C<$app-E<gt>moniker> if not specified.

=head2 mode

	mode => 'test'

Will use this value in place of %m (mode) in filenames. Defaults to C<$app-E<gt>mode> if not specified.

=head2 dir

	dir => 'my_config_dir'

Will load config files from this directory. Defaults to C<$app-E<gt>home('conf')> if not specified.

=head2 files

	files => ['file1.conf', 'file2.%u.conf']

Will load these config files instead of the default. You can use template codes as per DESCRIPTION section.

Defaults to C<['%a.%e', '%a.%m.%e', '%a.%m.%u.%e']> if not specified.

=head2 ext

	ext => 'yml'

Will use this value in place of %e (file extension) in filenames. Defaults to C<conf> if not specified.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 register

Register as a plugin and load config files. Called automatically by C<$app-E<gt>plugin>

=cut

sub register
{
	my $self = shift;
	my $app  = shift;
	my $arg  = shift;
	my $config = {};
	eval { $username = ( getpwuid ($<) )[0]; }; # Not on Windows!
    $username ||= $ENV{USERNAME};
	my @files;

	# Default args if not set
	$arg->{moniker} //= $app->moniker;
	$arg->{mode}    //= $app->mode;
	$arg->{dir}     //= catfile($app->home, 'conf');
	$arg->{files}   //= ['%a.%e', '%a.%m.%e', '%a.%m.%u.%e'];
	$arg->{ext}     //= 'conf';

	for (my $i = 0; $i < @{$arg->{files}}; $i++) {
		# Prefix dir
		$arg->{files}->[$i] = catfile($arg->{dir}, $arg->{files}->[$i]);

		# Search/replace for codes used in files
		$arg->{files}->[$i] =~ s/\%a/$arg->{moniker}/g;
		$arg->{files}->[$i] =~ s/\%m/$arg->{mode}/g;
		$arg->{files}->[$i] =~ s/\%u/$username/g;
		$arg->{files}->[$i] =~ s/\%e/$arg->{ext}/g;

		if (-e $arg->{files}->[$i]) {
			$app->log->debug(__PACKAGE__ . ': found ' . $arg->{files}->[$i]);
		}
		else {
			$app->log->debug(__PACKAGE__ . ': cannot find ' . $arg->{files}->[$i]);
			splice(@{$arg->{files}}, $i--, 1);
		}
	}

	# Load the config file(s)
	my $config_tmp = Config::Any->load_files({
		files           => $arg->{files},
		use_ext         => 1,
		flatten_to_hash => 1,
		driver_args => {
			General => {-UTF8 => 1},
		},
	});

	# Merge
	$config = {%$config, %{$config_tmp->{$_}}} for (@{$arg->{files}});

	$app->config($config);
	$app->log->debug($app->dumper($config));
	
	return $config;
}
